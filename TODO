TODO:
        think about a way to make removesrc work on all distributions ('*'?)
	-> or make things like remove(src)/list/.. work with distribution globs...
	write something for manual.html how to manually modify snapshots...
	write more automated test-cases
	 (not even run in the testcase yet: reoverride, ... (probably many))
	finish import from incoming dir, implement sending mails to uploader
	extend FilterList et al to specify type/architecture/component
	add switch to only include if source is present
	action to redownload missing pool/ files from some update-rules (looking for md5sum)
	Fields to exclude architectures and components in update rules,
	 (or alternatively allow ! in inclusion lists).

half far goals:
	rewrite error handling, caching error messages and handling Ctrl-C better.

far goals:
	check for unmeet Dependencies
	      for unmeet Build-dependencies.
	write dokumentation, some examples
	allow multiple versions in a distribution (needs major rewrite I fear)
	record timestamp when packages are added.
	option to keep apt-get'able source to each binary (needs mutliple source versions)
	switch from libdb?.? to sane database
