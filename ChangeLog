2022-08-30  Bastian Germann <bage@debian.org>

	Add SHA512 support (Thanks to Hu Deng)

2022-08-17  Bastian Germann <bage@debian.org>

	* debfilecontents.c: If data tar extraction fails try again as uncompressed
	Some packages have an uncompressed data.tar.gz.
	It seems that the "ar" code doesn't support reading a member more
	than once, so it is necessary to retry the whole process in
	uncompressed mode rather than just retrying reading the data member.
	* signedfile.c: Prevent duplicated keyid in signing error message
	Reported by: Uwe Kleine-KÃ¶nig
	* configure.ac: Release version 5.4.1 with patches from Debian bug tracker

2022-08-17  Luca Capello <luca.capello@infomaniak.com>

	* docs/mail-changes.example: new file to notify processing of .changes files

2013-12-18  Bernhard R. Link <brlink@debian.org>

	* checkin.c, ignore.h: Add --ignore=conflictingarchall
	This is useful if autobuilders for more than one architecture will
	build Architecture: all packages of the same version.
	Based on a patch by Sjoerd Simons.

2022-07-27  Bastian Germann <bage@debian.org>

	Integrate Benjamin Drung's work

	* ChangeLog: Add missing entries

	* tests/basic.sh, tests/multiversion.sh:
	Add test cases for Archive option
	* distribution.c, distribution.h, docs/reprepro.1, target.c:
	Add Archive option

2017-02-27  Benjamin Drung <benjamin.drung@profitbricks.com>

	* tests/basic.sh, tests/multiversion.sh: Add test cases for move* commands.
	Add test cases for the move, movesrc, movematched, movefilter commands.

2017-03-30  Benjamin Drung <benjamin.drung@profitbricks.com>

	* copypackages.c: package_add: Add fromtracks parameter

2017-02-23  Benjamin Drung <benjamin.drung@profitbricks.com>

	* copypackages.c: Add fromtarget to struct target_package_list.
	The move commands needs access to the from target to remove the
	packages after adding them to the destination target.
	* copypackages.c, copypackages.h, main.c:
	Enhance copy functions parameters to support moving
	* database.c: Convert old database format into new format
	* docs/reprepro.1, docs/reprepro.bash_completion, main.c: Add move* commands.
	Add the commands move, movesrc, movematched, movefilter.
	* copypackages.c: Implement remove source support

2017-02-24  Benjamin Drung <benjamin.drung@profitbricks.com>

	* database.c: Remove tracking of opened individual databases
	* database.c: Add print_opened_tables (for debugging purposes)
	* database.c: Keep track of all opened database tables.
	The move command will need to open two tables at the same time (the
	source table and the destination table). Thus keep track of all
	opened tables.

2017-04-11  Benjamin Drung <benjamin.drung@profitbricks.com>

	Use database environment

	* database.c: When opening multiple databases in parallel (needed for the
	move command or the archive option), the databases needs to be configured
	with locking. Thus an database environment is needed. Open and close
	the database environment when getting/releasing the database lock.

2018-08-27  Benjamin Drung <benjamin.drung@profitbricks.com>

	* tests/multiversion.sh, tests/old-database/conf/distributions,
	tests/old-database/db/version: Add test case for bug
	"Database migration screws up database names"

2017-02-07  Benjamin Drung <benjamin.drung@profitbricks.com>

	* tests/Makefile.am, tests/basic.sh, tests/multiversion.sh,
	tests/shunit2-helper-functions.sh: Add multiversion test
	cases

2017-02-28  Benjamin Drung <benjamin.drung@profitbricks.com>

	Add Limit option

	* configparser.h, distribution.c, distribution.h, docs/reprepro.1, target.c:
	Limit the number of versions of a package per distribution,
	architecture, component, and type. The limit must be a number. If
	the number is positive, all old package version that exceed these
	limit will be removed when a new package version is added. If the
	number is zero or negative, all package version will be kept. By
	default only one package version will be kept.

2018-08-30  Benjamin Drung <benjamin.drung@profitbricks.com>

	* tracking.c: Support multiple versions for removesrc command

2017-02-06  Benjamin Drung <benjamin.drung@profitbricks.com>

	* database.c: Support adding the same upstream tarball twice.
	DB_DUPSORT allows duplicate keys in the database, but not
	duplicate key/value pairs. Only if the duplicate data items are unsorted,
	applications may store identical duplicate data items.
	Since the references.db stores a the filekey mapping to the
	codename|component|architecture triplet, there might be identical
	duplicates, when upstream tarballs are references by multiple
	version.  Therefore switch references.db from DB_DUPSORT to DB_DUP.
	* main.c: Use nameandversion struct for remove command.
	The multiple version support will require to pass a list of names
	and versions to the remove_from_target() function instead of just a
	list of names. Thus use the nameandversion struct for the remove
	command.
	* copypackages.c, database.c, database.h, docs/reprepro.1, main.c,
	release.c, target.c: Add multiple version management

2017-02-23  Benjamin Drung <benjamin.drung@profitbricks.com>

	table_addrecord: Support non-duplicate tables

	* database.c: The DB_NODUPDATA flag may only be specified if the underlying
	database has been configured to support sorted duplicates. Thus do
	not set the DB_NODUPDATA flag when the database does not support
	duplicates. To avoid querying the flags on each call, save the flags
	when opening the table.

2017-02-02  Benjamin Drung <benjamin.drung@profitbricks.com>

	Introduce nameandversion struct for copy command

	* copypackages.c, copypackages.h, main.c:
	The multiple version support will require to pass a list of names
	and versions to the copy_by_name() function instead of just a list
	of names.  Thus introduce a nameandversion struct that also holds
	the data needed for the copy_by_name() function.

2018-08-29  Benjamin Drung <benjamin.drung@profitbricks.com>

	Fix "Package database is not sorted" in update command

	* upgradelist.c: When multiple versions of one package are available in the archive,
	the update command will fail:
	```
	Calculating packages to get...
	Package database is not sorted!!!
	reprepro: upgradelist.c:135: save_package_version: Assertion `false' failed.
	Aborted
	```
	Fix this assertion error by iterating only over the newest version of each package.

2018-08-29  Benjamin Drung <benjamin.drung@profitbricks.com>

	package_openiterator: Pass through duplicate option

2018-08-29  Benjamin Drung <benjamin.drung@profitbricks.com>

	Add duplicate option to table_newglobalcursor

	* database.c, database.h, filelist.c, files.c, main.c, reference.c,
	sizes.c, target.c, tracking.c: Allow to open a cursor that either
	iterates over all database entries or only over the first of each
	duplicate (i.e. only the latest version of each package).

2017-02-08  Benjamin Drung <benjamin.drung@profitbricks.com>

	Support listing multiple versions in list command

	* main.c: Currently only one package version is supported for each target,
	but prepare support for multiple versions. Instead of querying only one
	package for each target in the list command, iterate over all
	packages with the given name for each target.

2017-02-03  Benjamin Drung <benjamin.drung@profitbricks.com>

	Support listing multiple versions in ls command

	* main.c: Currently only one package version is supported for each target,
	but prepare support for multiple versions. Instead of querying only one
	package for each target in the ls command, iterate over all packages
	with the given name for each target.

2017-04-10  Benjamin Drung <benjamin.drung@profitbricks.com>

	* distribution.h, tracking.c, tracking.h:
	Remember opened tracking databases
	* copypackages.c, incoming.c, main.c, needbuild.c, tracking.c, tracking.h:
	Pass distribution to tracking_done.
	For a later commit, pass the distribution to tracking_done.

2017-03-28  Benjamin Drung <benjamin.drung@profitbricks.com>

	package_openiterator: Support opened databases

	* package.h, target.c: This change is a preparation for the
	package_openduplicateiterator() function.

2017-04-10  Benjamin Drung <benjamin.drung@profitbricks.com>

	Change error handling

	* target.c: Use variable 'result' only for the final returned result.

2017-02-06  Benjamin Drung <benjamin.drung@profitbricks.com>

	* database.c: table_close: Set default return value

2017-02-02  Benjamin Drung <benjamin.drung@profitbricks.com>

	* main.c: Introduce splitnameandversion().
	The multi version support will require splitting the
	name and version in multiple places. Thus moved the code in a
	splitnameandversion() function.
	* main.c, target.c, target.h, upgradelist.c:
	target_removepackage: Support specifying package version.
	If no package version is specfied, use the latest version.
	* main.c: rename todo to remaining.
	The word 'todo' is used for marking todo items for the programmer.
	Thus use 'remaining' instead of 'todo' as variable name.
	* database.c: Move cursor struct upwards.
	Move cursor struct upwards to have the struct definition in one block.
	* globals.h: Add helper function strcmp2()
	* copypackages.c: Add helper function cascade_strcmp()
	* target.h: Add helper function package_primarykey()
	* database.c, error.h: Add helper function get_package_name()
	* database.c: Add helper function debianversioncompare()

2017-02-01  Benjamin Drung <benjamin.drung@profitbricks.com>

	* database.c: table_getrecord: Add newline to error message
	* database.c: table_printerror: Improve database error message

2017-02-03  Benjamin Drung <benjamin.drung@profitbricks.com>

	* database.c: Introduce static newcursor() function.
	There are multiple places where new cursors are generated.
	Remove duplicate code by introducing the newcursor() function.
	* target.c: Print version when removing a package
	* database.c, database.h, files.c, main.c, reference.c:
	Merge cursor_nexttemp() into cursor_nexttempdata().
	cursor_nexttempdata has an additional len_p output parameter (compared
	to cursor_nexttemp). Make the len_p output parameter optional and
	replace cursor_nexttemp by cursor_nexttempdata.
	Thus cursor_nexttemp(...) becomes cursor_nexttempdata(..., NULL).
	* database.c: Introduce parse_data().
	The cursor_nextpair() function has a parse_pair() function for
	evaluating the returned database output. Introduce a similar
	parse_data() function for the cursor_nexttempdata() function.
	* database.c: Introduce cursor_next().
	The functions cursor_nexttempdata() and cursor_nextpair() share a similar logic.
	Thus combine the duplicate code in cursor_next().
	cursor_nexttempdata() set always DB_NEXT as cursor flag instead of
	using the cursor->flags value. All users of cursor_nexttempdata()
	call table_newglobalcursor() beforehand.
	* database.c, database.h, tracking.c: rename table_newduplicatecursor.
	Rename table_newduplicatecursor to table_newduplicatepairedcursor
	to make use this name for a data cursor.
	* database.c, database.h: Add helper function table_newduplicatecursor()
	* package.h, target.c: Add helper function package_openduplicateiterator()

2018-08-27  Benjamin Drung <benjamin.drung@profitbricks.com>

	* guesscomponent.c: Fix missing quotation mark in component list.
	The error message in guess_component misses a leading quotation
	mark, for example: Could not find 'main' in components of 'bionic': contrib'

2017-03-30  Benjamin Drung <benjamin.drung@profitbricks.com>

	* tests/trackingcorruption.test, tracking.c:
	Fix typo "could not found" -> "could not find"

2017-02-03  Benjamin Drung <benjamin.drung@profitbricks.com>

	Evaluate return value of write command

	* signature.c: Compiling reprepro produces this warning:
	```
	signature.c: In function âsignature_getpassphraseâ:
	signature.c:63:2: warning: ignoring return value of âwriteâ, declared with attribute warn_unused_result [-Wunused-result]
	  write(fd, p, strlen(p));
	  ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	signature.c:64:2: warning: ignoring return  value of âwriteâ, declared with attribute warn_unused_result [-Wunused-result]
	  write(fd, "\n", 1);
	  ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	```

2014-05-30  Benjamin Drung <benjamin.drung@profitbricks.com>

	* main.c: Fix indentation (spaces to tabs)

2017-08-22  Benjamin Drung <benjamin.drung@profitbricks.com>

	Use useful names for .changes files

	* tests/genpackage.sh: Use the common naming schema $source_$version_$arch.changes
	for the name of the .changes files for testing.

2017-03-28  Benjamin Drung <benjamin.drung@profitbricks.com>

	* tests/genpackage.sh: Silence output
	* tests/genpackage.sh: Use existing priority.
	Using the non-existing priority 'superfluous' causes warning messages.

2017-02-06  Benjamin Drung <benjamin.drung@profitbricks.com>

	* tests/genpackage.sh: Use the host architecture by default.
	To be able to build packages for the tests, use the host
	architecture (to avoid requiring a cross-compiler).
	* tests/genpackage.sh: Use dpkg-source format 3.0.
	To test the handling of upstream tarballs,
	switch from source format 1.0 to either 3.0 (quilt) or 3.0 (native).
	* tests/Makefile.am, tests/basic.sh, tests/shunit2-helper-functions.sh:
	Add basic shunit2 based tests

	* fix more spelling errors
	* fix some spelling errors in comments
	* fix some spelling errors in the manpage
	* handle a missing Binary field in a .changes file like an empty one.
	  (So not having one in a source only upload will be ignored,
	  while a missing one in a binary upload will complain about the
	  packages not listed in Binary: instead of complaining about not
	  having a Binary field).

2018-09-23  Bernhard R. Link <brlink@debian.org>
	* check command no longer checks if the files
	  of existing packages are names as they are
	  expected to be named. (There was no way to
	  get them wrong apart editing the database and
	  checking it makes the code more complex).

	  support concatenated streams

2016-12-21  Bernhard R. Link <brlink@debian.org>
	* fix behaviour of (Deb|Dsc)Indices without a Release file
	  (if no Release filename was given the default was used
	   instead of not creating a file)
	* document what is needed to use --ask-passphrase with newer
	  gnupg versions in the manpage

2016-12-21  Bernhard R. Link <brlink@debian.org>
	* add support for .buildinfo files in .changes files:
	- new tracking mode includebuildinfos to store them in pool/
	- ignored by 'include' unless Tracking: includebuildinfos

	* fix some logical errors in some warnings.

2016-10-22  Bernhard R. Link <brlink@debian.org>
	* drop workaround for apt-method interface change:
	  answer 103 is now always expected to end the method's doing
	  (in other words the http apt method from squeeze and before is no
	  longer supported)

2016-03-*  Bernhard R. Link <brlink@debian.org>
	* refactor code to use struct package and struct package_cursor
	  most of the time package data is accessed.

2016-03-13  Bernhard R. Link <brlink@debian.org>
	* fix bug in flood that could get confused which binary package
	  belongs to which source if a destination contains packages
	  belonging to different versions of the same souce.
	* fix bug in the message about "warning" triggered in FilterList
	  of pull. ('(null)' was printed instead of the package name).

2014-06-28  Bernhard R. Link <brlink@debian.org>
	* fix compiling without liblzma.

	  is that those files are removed if there are no longer
	  requested.

2012-12-09  Bernhard R. Link <brlink@debian.org>
	* unify export handling (moving it out of the
	  action specific code)

2012-12-02  Bernhard R. Link <brlink@debian.org>

	* add --endhook to start a script when terminating

2012-11-04  Bernhard R. Link <brlink@debian.org>
	* add repairdescriptions command to readd  missing long
	  descriptions (which you might get as reprepro cannot yet
	  get Translations files and get them from there)
	  from the .deb files.

2012-10-30  Bernhard R. Link <brlink@debian.org>
	* add ${$basename}, ${$filekey} and ${$fullfilename} to --listformat

	* fix some errors when compiled without libgpgme

2012-05-20
	* normalize included package control information to
	  always start with the Package: field (as some clients
	  assume that).
	* don't require md5sum to download binary or source packages
	  in the remote index files (any known hash suffices)

	* avoid some problem with gcc-4.7

2012-04-24
	* change Contents-* files generation default from

	* reject "any" as Architecture part of a distribution

2012-01-21
	* build-needing now can list missing architecture 'all'
	  packages. (Will not list .dsc files producing both
	  architecture dependent and architecture indepentent ('all')
	  packages unless they are built with dpkg-dev >= 1.16.1,
	  though).

2012-01-19

	* when using nocompatsymlink in Contents warn about
	  old file/symlink still present.

2010-09-28

	* add compatsymlink nocompatsymlink Contents: options
	  (and document that the default will change in the future)

2010-08-22
	* add 'redochecksums' command to complete the checksum information
	in package indices.

2010-08-19
	* add percomponent and allcomponents to Contents: flags

	Currently the default is allcomponents but that will switch
	later.
	* fix bug that would delete files only to be deleted after an
	successful export also when aborting an export

	  message if data start like unsigned file should start.

2010-04-16
	* add 'FilterSrcList'.

2010-04-15
	* Many clean-ups and coding style fixes.

2010-03-30
	* Support specifying a version in FilterList

2010-02-29
	* support compiling with libdb5
	* fix memory bug in filelist generation
	  (as realloc usually not moves stuff when reducing the size that
	   is no real issue, but newer valgrind detects it and warns).

2010-02-28
	* 'check' also checks if architectures match
	* fix 'sourcemissing', 'unusedsources' and 'reportcruft'

	* allow patterns in override files

2010-06-29

2010-06-26
	* store override data in a tree instead of an list and
	some preparations for patterns in override files.

2010-06-25
	* Ignore overrides for fields starting with '$' and
	warn about unknown fields to allow later introduction
	of special values.
	* disallow overrides of core fields (Package, Version,
	Filename, ...)

2010-05-07
	* add --onlysmalldeletes option that cancels pulls
	and updates that delete more than 20% of some target
	(but at least 10 packages). The change also causes
	update no longer claiming to get packages if there are
	not any packages to get...

2010-04-30
	* change parsing of .changes lines to cope with
	N_V.orig-X.tar.C files where V.orig-X does not survive
	a proper version check (underscores most prominently).

2010-01-18
	* properly handle relative LogDir in conf/incoming

2009-12-08
	* add byhand statement to uploaders files

2009-11-22
	* fix build with --without-libgpgme
	(thanks to Reto Gantenbein for reporting)

2009-11-16
	* include <stdint.h> where *int*_t is used

2009-11-13
	* 'include' now errors out early if the .changes includes source files but
	no .dsc file.

2009-11-12
	* add mode to rredtool to act as reprepro index hook and generate
	and update a *.diff/Index file.

2009-11-06
	* when 'include'ing a .changes file, do not insist on section
	information of non-.dsc source files.

2009-10-27
	* Do not warn about a missing VerifyRelease if there is a
	IgnoreRelease.
	* Handle apt transport methods returning missing files as
	success with alternate filename suggestion more gracefully.
	* when getting packages from another architecture while updating,
	ignore all packages with architecture not fitting into the target.
	(Fixes a regression introduced in 3.8.0)

2009-10-21
	* reduce number of places where new compressions must be added
	* improve checking for proper filenames in changestool's verify
	* allow .build as synonym for .log as suffix in changes files

	* reduce number of places where new compressions must be added

2009-10-17
	* support xz compressed files if unxz is installed.

	* make 'check' (and some other commands) warn if a file expected
	is not in the checksums database but found correctly in the pool.

2009-09-23
	* Method: and Fallback: in conf/updates now strip the last '/' from
	the URI given. (Some apt methods get confused if they get "//").

2009-09-15
	* fix exit-code of 'list' with --nothingiserror

2009-09-10
	* call gpgme_check_version so that libgpgme 1.2.0 does not fail
	to initialize.

2009-08-24
	* remove all files.db code (except translatelegacyfilelists).
	* remove --oldfilesdb option.
	* remove --overridedir

2009-08-23
	* warn if old legacy files.db is still used and add new
	translatelegacyfilelists command for easier migration.

2009-08-21
	* new --showpercent option to show percent and total
	download size when downloading packages.
	* do not output the new warning about a new architecture
	when all architectures are new (i.e. new distribution)

2009-08-20
	* new 'Options: limit_arch_all' in conf/incoming causes
	processincoming to only put architecture all packages into
	the architectures uploaded with them to allow usage together
	with 'flood'.

2009-08-18
	* speed up 'flood' by using an tree instead of a list for source
	package lookups.

2009-08-17
	* add new 'flood' command to distribute architecture all packages
	within one architecture.

2009-08-15
	* -A, -T and -C can now have multiple arguments separated by '|'.

2009-08-13
	* FakeComponentPrefix now does not add the prefix to components
	already having it and removes it from the relative directory where
	it is put into (so no duplication on the whole path, either).

2009-08-06
	* command line (and conf/options) options to specify a directory
	now treat arguments starting with '+b/', '+c/' or '+o/' as relative
	to the basedir, confdir or outdir.
	* warn if directories do not start with '/', './' or '+x/'.

2009-08-05
	* if a package is not accepted by processincoming because no
	distribution is found for it or no distribution allows it, the
	existcode is now 243

2009-08-03
	* add a MorgueDir option to conf/incoming where cleaned up files
	are moved to.
	* if a .changes has improper name, version or architectures,
	trigger the 'Cleanup: on_error' case.

2009-08-01
	* improve deleteunreferenced's error message with keepunreferencedfiles

2009-07-25
	* add $Version, $Source, $SourceVersion, $Architecture, $Component,
	$PackageType as special fields in formulas.

2009-07-21
	* fix build-needing to look at the correct Architecture field in
	.dsc files.

2009-07-20
	* add an --morguedir where files removed from the pool are
	stored.

2009-07-15
	* add --create-with-all-fields to changestool that is
	like --create but also creates Urgency and Changes fields.

2009-07-11
	* make predelete also call retrack when needed,
	  silence false warning of stale tracking by removesrc

2009-07-10
	* warn if a distribution with tracking is modified in a form tracking
	data might get out of data. update and pull automatically cause a
	retrack on distributions with tracking enabled.

2009-07-09
	* some more improvements to the build-needing command

2009-07-07
	* fix bug in processincoming not accepting Suite or AlsoAcceptFor
	because of counting it two times and erroring out.
	(Thanks to Wookey for finding this bug).

2009-06-16
	* add listmatched, removematched, copymatched and restorematched.
	(For those who think listfilter 'Package (% glob)' is too hard
	 to write, to remember or too slow).
	* add build-needing command

2009-06-05
	* add glob-matching in formulas via '(% pattern)'
	* uploaders list conditions that supported stars
	  now use the generic globmatch (thus more stars and ? and []).

2009-06-03
	* new --list-max and --list-skip

2009-06-02
	* new 'architectures' condition for uploader lists and other
	conditions support 'contains' now.

2009-05-31
	* add --list-format

2009-05-29
	* add _listdbidentifiers and _listconfidentifiers
	* add condition "source 'something'" for uploader lists,
	to limit a uploader to packages with the specified source.

2009-05-22
	* allow subkey matching in uploader lists, 'unsigned' now only
	means unsigned while the new 'anybody' means everybody.
	Preparations for more conditions.

2009-05-12
	* copy and copysrc give warnings about not found packages unless
	  verbosity is reduced by --silent. (To help people catch their typos).

2009-04-13
	* rewrite Release.gpg verification code:
	- to allow usage of expired or revoced keys, the key-id
	  in VerifyRelease has to be appended with '!' and the corresponding
	  new ignore option given.
	- subkeys are accepted if the key-id is appended with '+'.
	- keys are requested from libgpgme before anything is downloaded
	  (helps catching c&p errors and makes subkey checks possible).
	- if verification fails, the status of all found signatures is printed.

2009-04-07
	* bugfix: ListHook was not used in rules including the rule with it
	in "From:"
	* add "ListShellHook", that is like ListHook but with arguments and
	the files in stdin and stdout.

2009-04-03
	* fix bug (caught by assertion) that inverts the logic of downloading
	.diff files when there is no DownLoadListsAs line.

2009-03-18
	* support new suffix ".new." for export hooks.
	(Which moves filename + ".new" to filename on success,
	but unlike ".new" does not mention the file in Release)
	* new suffix ".keep" for export hooks tha just ignores that line,
	for compatibility with future changes.
	* warn if an (Deb|UDeb|Dsc)Indices line contains no filename.
	(warn against everything starting with a dot to avoid a user putting
	forgetting it and putting a compression identifier there).

2009-03-14
	* fix mishandling of libz return code
	causing "Zlib error 1"..."stream end" error messages.
	This defect seems to be only triggered with at least lenny's libz.
	(And only when extracting Section and Priority from a dsc).

2009-03-05
	* Implement force.<compression> as DownLoadListAs item to download an
	index not found in the Release file.
	* warn if database is in old format

2009-03-04
	* also continue downloading index files after failure to get the
	prefered one in the IgnoreRelease case.

2009-03-03
	* regression fix: when updating with IgnoreRelease, old index
	files were no longer deleted in 3.8 before telling the apt-methods to
	download new ones, which can trigger buggy behaviour in those.
	* if one index file fails to be downloaded, try the next one
	(except for updates with IgnoreRelease, yet)

2009-03-02
	* fix bug not taking all DownloadListAs into account when multiple
	update rules requests the same index file to be downloaded.
	* if a .diff/Index file does not list the available Packages file
	or if not for targeted file, proceed with other ways to retrieve
	it.
	* add .diff processing as first default when there is no
	DownloadListsAs.

2009-03-01
	* support using Packages.diff when updating.
	(Fallback to other methods not yet supported, so not yet enabled
	 in the default DownloadlistsAs)

2009-02-28
	* fix some bugs in --nothingiserror handling

2009-02-27
	* move handling of downloaded files from aptmethod.c to
	the code queuing the files. (refactorisation in preparation of later
	changes)

2009-02-24
	* fix race condition causing external uncompressors sometimes
	to catch a sigpipe if their output is closed before they receive
	the signal to kill them.
	* changestool now supports looking into lzma files
	(and bz2 files even when not compiled against libbz2), if
	external uncompressors are available.
	* fix bug extracting the Section and Priority from .diff
	files if control was not the first file in it.
	* fix bug .diff parsing's exception to also allow diff
	generated files.

2009-02-23
	* log notifiers get variables REPREPRO_CAUSING_RULE and
	REPREPRO_FROM set when adding packages via update/pull.
	The later also in copy* and restore* commands.
	* delete unexpected (i.e. not registered in the database)
	files in pool when trying to replace with new ones.

2009-02-21
	* add --keeptemporaries and without it delete all .new files when
	exporting fails (and not only Release) and with it keep all
	(including Release). Also fix gpg error message to not suggest trying
	it with a file that later will be deleted.

2009-02-20
	* add 'warning' flag for FilterList files

2009-02-13
	* add ReadOnly option for conf/distributions

2009-02-08
	* processincoming support includebyhand and includelogs tracking
	  options
	* new LogDir for processincoming, that gets the .changes files,
	  .log files and unused byhand (or raw-*) files.

2009-02-06
	* ignore byhand and logfiles in 'include' unless tracking
	  with includebyhand or includelogs is activated, then store them
	  into the pool.

2009-01-22
	* fix typo causing copyfilter to fail
	* add --gnupghome option to set GNUPGHOME environment variable
	* fix importing of source packages from flat repositories without
	a Directory field in Sources index.

2009-01-17
	* fix erroneous "strange filekey" warning for lib files in 3.8.0~alpha

2009-01-16
	* make Date: more like official Release files by replacing
	the old "+0000" with "UTC".

2009-01-15
	* add support to generate Valid-Until in Release

2009-01-09
	* handle 'raw-*' sections like 'byhand' sections (i.e. mostly not
	  handle them, but give better error messages).

2009-01-06
	* add DownloadListsAs: option for conf/updates to specify which index
	  files (.gz, .bz2, .lzma, ...) to download when available.

2009-01-04
	* add support for libdb4.7 (yet with some warnings to note I have not
	tested it much yet)
	* bugfix in checkpool with old files.db

2009-01-02
	* FilterList/FilterFormula can be inherited with From: in update rules.
	* bugfix: if FilterList return hold, FilterFormula was not asked.
	  Not it is only hold if FilterFormula also includes this package.
	  (pull/update)
	* if a distribution is both flat and non-flat, do not raise an
	  assert, but emmit a warning and proceed (new flatandnonflat ignore
	  class to ignore that warning).

2008-12-06
	* add 'upgradeonly' value for FilterList, that only takes
	  an package into account if it already exists.

2008-12-02
	* implement cleanlists command

2008-11-24
	* fix bug in sha256 calculation over very large files

2008-11-13
	* add dumpupdate and dumppull actions that are like checkupdate and
	checkpull but with less information but that more easily parseable.

2008-11-04
	* fix parsing error of contents of very big .deb files.
	Thanks to Aramian Wasielak and Alexander Perlis.

2008-11-03
	* rework handling of files added to the pool not used by anything.
	(for example because the package was not added due to error).
	New --keepunusednewfiles option to not delete such files.

2008-11-01
	* print number of newly unreferenced file on --keepunreferenced
	and commands not deleting their references.

2008-10-30
	* add support for flat repositories with Sources files without
	Directory lines (Thanks to Cody A.W. Somerville for noting).

2008-10-12
	* some rework on unreferenced files bookkeeping. Should make no
	  difference yet but only make the "Deleting files not longer
	  referenced" only show up if something is deleted...

2008-10-05
	* Internaly atomize components architectures and packagetypes.
	  Causes multiple checks for unknown identifiers to be earlier or
	  more strict. (And fields in conf/distributions have more
	  restrictions w.r.t their order).
	* fix bug in (tracking enabled) removesrc that caused malformed
	  tracking data when a source package's track record contains a
	  file no longer found in any distribution.
	  [2009-01-16: I previously believed this nearly impossible to
	  trigger, but a simply outdated tracking data already suffices
	  to trigger it]

2008-10-01
	* warn if an update rule references local components or architectures
	  that were not seen in conf/distributions (old behaviour was to check
	  if any distribution that references this rule had this architecture,
	  but that was too complex with the new rule-can-reference-rule
	  possibilities).

2008-09-18
	* update rules can include other rules with From: allowing
	  leaner conf/updates file and avoiding duplicate downloading
	  of upstream indices.
	* do not process distributions without Updates: field upon
	  update/checkupdate/predelete...

2008-09-09
	* also support external uncompression programs for
	  .orig.tar/.debian.tar/.tar uncompression, i.e.:
	- support Section/Priority extraction from lzma compressed dsc packages
	- libarchive no longer needs to be linked against zlib/libbz2
	* fix some corner cases in .diff parsing

2008-09-07
	* add support for external uncompression programs
	- speeding up updating, as downloading and uncompressing
	  can happen at the same time
	- support lzma compressed .deb and .diff (when unlzma is available)
	- supporting .bz2 compressed files even when compiled without libbz2
	  (but needing runtime bunzip2 then)
	* make --nooldfilesdb the default

2008-08-24
	* unify reading of compressed files, adding support for:
	- extracting section and priority from a .diff.bz2
	- restoring from a snapshot with only .bz2 indices

2008-08-23
	* massive refactorisation of the update code to retrieve
	  remote index files. Most important modifications:
	- when the same remote distribution is needed by multiple
	  updates, then the index files are only downloaded once.
	  (still needs futher changes to allow better detection
	   of the same source).
	- ListHooks are called once per use (should mostly only
	  make a difference for flat sources or with settings
	  where this is needed).
	- --nolistsdownload now only not downloads lists and has
	  no other effects (checksums still checked, --noskipold
	  no longer implied).
	- deleting of old no longer needed lists (the default
	  --nokeepunneeded) no longer exists.
	- index files are stored uncompressed in lists/ and the
	  way files are named there is less strange...
	- many other changes are possible now and will hopefully
	  be implemented soon.
	* support downloading .bz2 indices
	* add --via to Log-notifiers to only call notification
	  scripts when the action was triggered by a specific
	  command.

2008-08-22
	* some internal cleanup preparing for future changes...

2008-08-16

	* remove iteratedupdate

2008-07-30
	* fix double-free whith --export=never

	* add support to retrieve packages from flat repositories.

2008-07-25
	* refactor indexfile parsing. (Needed for future changes,
	perhaps speeding some things up a tiny littly bit).
	* fix logic error causing restorefilter aborting

2008-07-23
	* Do not claim --noskipold makes a difference in the update output
	for targets not having any upstream to pull from.

2008-07-22
	* better cope with a file needed multiple times when
	  updating

2008-07-12
	* make list package argument optional, listing all
	packages if not there.
	* fix bug causing assert() instead of proper error message
	if list gets too many arguments.

2008-07-03
	* add IgnoreHashes directive for conf/updates

2008-06-26  Bernhard R. Link <brlink@debian.org>
	* add FakeComponentPrefix, that adds a prefix to components
	in the Release file and removes them from Codename and Suite
	in the central Release file. This way it looks more like
	security /updates and thus apt is not confused.

2008-06-25  Bernhard R. Link <brlink@debian.org>
	* avoid creating symlinks that cannot work because of
	a '/' in the link to create.

2008-06-23  Bernhard R. Link <brlink@debian.org>
	* fix bug in optionsfilename calculating introduced in
	last revision.

2008-06-22  Bernhard R. Link <brlink@debian.org>
	* move some directoy variables to global variables,
	some related cleanup in the code
	* set REPREPRO_BASE_DIR, REPREPRO_OUT_DIR, REPREPRO_DIST_DIR,

	apt methods, update hooks or export hooks.

2008-06-07  Bernhard R. Link <brlink@debian.org>
	* remove some checks that fail for version 2 or 3 debian
	source packages. (in reprepro include and changestool verify)
	* extract missing Section and Priority also from a .debian.tar.{gz,bz2}
	file.

2008-06-06  Bernhard R. Link <brlink@debian.org>
	* switch to 'new' AC_INIT and AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE syntax,
	move automaitcally included autoconf to ac/ subdir
	* fix typo causing internal error when removesrc
	is called for a distribution with tracking for an unknown
	source name.

2008-05-17  Bernhard R. Link <brlink@debian.org>

	to use some versions of dupload.

2008-05-16  Bernhard R. Link <brlink@debian.org>
	* When include'ing a .changes file with Checksums
	header and limiting to some files with -A or -T, do
	not errounously complain about not expecting the
	skipped files in Checksums-* headers
	* Look at suite names when no distribution with the
	requested codename exists.

2008-05-15  Bernhard R. Link <brlink@debian.org>
	* Print warning when not including when not including a
	package because of unknown key/expire/revocation.
	(In addition to the warning with -v about those problems
	 with a signature and in addition to the message of not
	 including a package at all if that was the only chance to
	 get it in)

2008-04-17  Bernhard R. Link <brlink@debian.org>
	* fix free of uninitialized pointer when calling log notifiers
	while removing (this time for real)

2008-04-12  Bernhard R. Link <brlink@debian.org>
	* move assertion to not abort() on wrong md5sums in include
	command, but cleanly error out.
	* do not close random fd when starting client without
	control data.
	* fix free of uninitialized pointer when calling log notifiers
	while removing

2008-04-05  Bernhard R. Link <brlink@debian.org>
	* add restore restoresrc restorefilter and _addpackage

2008-04-04  Bernhard R. Link <brlink@debian.org>
	* add copysrc and copyfilter
	* reimplement copy command (should no longer invalidate
	  tracking information)
	* warn against impossible -T values and impossible
	  -A -T combinations (source is dsc and dsc is source)

2008-03-31  Bernhard R. Link <brlink@debian.org>
	* bugfix: no longer confuse -S and -P (introduced in 3.0.1)

2008-03-25  Bernhard R. Link <brlink@debian.org>
	* put a fake Suite: field in Release files generated by
	gensnapshot to avoid apt warning about the distribution
	name not matching.

2008-03-17  Bernhard R. Link <brlink@debian.org>
	* Log:-scripts are starting with environment-variable
	REPREPRO_CAUSING_FILE set to the main file causing this
	change. (.changes for include/processincoming, .dsc for includedsc,
	.deb for includedeb);

2008-03-14  Bernhard R. Link <brlink@debian.org>
	* read Checksums-Sha1 in .changes file in processincoming

2008-03-13  Bernhard R. Link <brlink@debian.org>
	* changestool can write Checksums-Sha1 headers now
	* read Checksums-Sha1 in .changes file in the include command

2008-03-12  Bernhard R. Link <brlink@debian.org>
	* Bugfix: When replacing fields only those matching with
	the same case were replaced.

2008-03-10  Bernhard R. Link <brlink@debian.org>
	* write Checksums-Sha1 to Sources.gz when available and
	remove Checksums-Sha256 to avoid problems with not yet being
	able to add the .dsc file.
	* Do not warn about missing Standards-Version as newer dpkg-source
	no longer include them.

2008-03-09  Bernhard R. Link <brlink@debian.org>
	* read Checksums-Sha1 in .dsc files

2008-03-08  Bernhard R. Link <brlink@debian.org>
	* When missing section or priority reprepro's includedsc and
	changestool's add[dsc] look into the .diff and the .tar file.
	* changestool's add* commands look for files in the current directory
	first, adddsc for files referenced in the directory of the dsc file.

2008-03-06  Bernhard R. Link <brlink@debian.org>
	* fix/improve some messages, based upon many suggestions

	to the pool in the case of an error.

2008-02-15  Bernhard R. Link <brlink@debian.org>
	* Also ignore missing Changes and Description lines
	in .changes files with "include".

2008-02-12  Bernhard R. Link <brlink@debian.org>
	* Add --outdir directive to set the directory the pool
	hierarchy is put under (and the dists hierarchy unless
	--distdir puts it somewhere else).

2008-02-11  Bernhard R. Link <brlink@debian.org>
	* fix --waitforlock parsing on 64 bit size_t architectures.
	  (Thanks to Arno Renevier for reporting the bug)

	to 3.3.0 when only using checksums.db

2008-01-13  Bernhard R. Link <brlink@debian.org>
	* improve collecting of not yet known checksums and using
	already recorded checksums in the database

2008-01-06  Bernhard R. Link <brlink@debian.org>
	* implement collectnewchecksums

2008-01-04  Bernhard R. Link <brlink@debian.org>
	* add checksums.db to store all checksums (as opposed to only md5sums
	in files.db). The old files.db persists for compatibility, but when
	checksums.db is up to date (when repository is generated with new
	reprepro or to be implemented collectnewchecksums was run) the old
	files.db can be deleted and only checksums.db is used then. (Of
	course you should not run an older reprepro with that repository
	then, ever).

2008-01-03  Bernhard R. Link <brlink@debian.org>
	* tracking.c uses database.c instead of libdb directly

	  not hurt.

2007-11-27  Bernhard R. Link <brlink@debian.org>
	* rewrite support for reading text files containing a single
	chunk. (Release, .dsc, .changes). Unsigned .dsc and .changes
	files are no longer routed through libgpgme.

2007-11-24  Bernhard R. Link <brlink@debian.org>
	* references.c uses database.c instead of accessing libdb directly

2007-11-19  Bernhard R. Link <brlink@debian.org>

	* add sha1 hashes of index files into Release files.
	  release.cache.db renmamed to release.caches.db due
	  to modified syntax.

2007-10-31  Bernhard R. Link <brlink@debian.org>
	* translatefilelists now can be run when both old
	and new style filelists are there (this can happen
	when it was translated and an old version of reprepro
	was run over this database. You should not do this,
	but when it happens, translatefilelists can be used
	now instead of having to reextract the lists).

2007-10-29  Bernhard R. Link <brlink@debian.org>
	* If exporting a distribution fails, warn if something is left
	in a state that needs manual exporting.

2007-10-26  Bernhard R. Link <brlink@debian.org>
	* change --export default from "normal" (now also available
	under the name "lookedat") to "changed".

2007-10-21  Bernhard R. Link <brlink@debian.org>
	* warn against -A,-C,-T,-S or -P given to an action not
	using it, with new --ignore=unusedoption to ignore this.

2007-10-07  Bernhard R. Link <brlink@debian.org>
	* change db/version file to final format,
	  abort if version or libdb version specified
	  there cannot be fulfilled.

2007-09-27  Bernhard R. Link <brlink@debian.org>
	* allow comments starting within lines in config files
	* also allow tab as first character for continued lines as
	manpage already says.

2007-09-23  Bernhard R. Link <brlink@debian.org>
	* save another 2 seconds while sorting filelists for Contents files

2007-09-22  Bernhard R. Link <brlink@debian.org>
	* make empty Architectures and Components fields
	  in conf/distributions an error.
	* Contents: fields no longer has a rate value,
	  ContentsComponents/Architectures/UComponents
	  triggers or disables contents generation if non-/empty.
	* empty Architecturs/Components/UdebComponents in
	  conf/updates and conf/pulls now mean nothing instead of all.
	* minimal additional speedup when sorting filelists

2007-09-21  Bernhard R. Link <brlink@debian.org>
	* save cached filelists of packages for Contents files
	in a preprocessed form, needing only about half the disk
	space and only half the time when generating the Contents file.
	* new translatefilelists command to translate old to new format
	* filelists reading no longer available without libarchive

2007-09-19  Bernhard R. Link <brlink@debian.org>
	* files.c uses database.c instead of accessing libdb directly

	* retrack no longer create track records for distributions with
	tracking disabled, dumptracks no longer generated empty databases.
	* removealltracks now also works on distributions no longer listed
	in conf/distributions, no longer supports being used on all
	distributions listed there (i.e. without argumnts)
	* tidytracks not remove all tracking data from a distribution without
	tracking activated.
	* clearvanished removes tracking data from vanished distributions.
	* in default --nofast mode, check for unexpected tracking data and
	do not run, unless --ignore=undefinedtracking is defined
	* retrack refreshes tracking information instead of destroying and
	starting new.
	* make update's ListHook relative to confdir
	* low level part of the includelogs options added

2007-09-11  Bernhard R. Link <brlink@debian.org>

	* improve parsing of update's Config lines

2007-09-09  Bernhard R. Link <brlink@debian.org>

	* warn if update rules list components or architectures are always ignored

2007-09-08  Bernhard R. Link <brlink@debian.org>
	* warn if pull rules list components or architectures are always ignored

2007-09-07  Bernhard R. Link <brlink@debian.org>
	* create db/version
	* always create all packages.db subtables, so future
	  versions can detect new architectures/components.

2007-09-06  Bernhard R. Link <brlink@debian.org>
	* read all distribution definitions before starting
	  any action.

2007-09-04  Bernhard R. Link <brlink@debian.org>
	* test number of arguments earlier.

2007-09-03  Bernhard R. Link <brlink@debian.org>
	* remove the dbdirs and all its parents created at startup
	that are still empty at shutdown. (Does not make much difference
	yet, as most commands create an empty file database in there.)
	* obsolete --overridedir, overrides belong to conf dir like all
	the other config files now.

2007-09-02  Bernhard R. Link <brlink@debian.org>

	* [SECURITY] fix bug causing a Release.gpg with only
	unknown signatures considered as properly signed.

2007-07-28  Bernhard R. Link <brlink@debian.org>
	* fix segfault in changestool's verify if

2007-07-26  Bernhard R. Link <brlink@debian.org>
	* add support for .changes file having the source

	first check if the file size matches before calculating
	its md5sum.

2007-06-11  Bernhard R. Link <brlink@debian.org>
	* detect "false" and "no" as false in boolean headers.
	(Until now only existence was tested and considered as
	 true, which broke apt-methods telling "Send-Config: false")

2007-06-10  Bernhard R. Link <brlink@debian.org>
	* don't waste filedescriptors by not closing .done-files

2007-06-09  Bernhard R. Link <brlink@debian.org>

2005-01-17  Bernhard R. Link <brlink@debian.org>

	  it warns if required fields are missing intead of
	  silently ignoring this block...

	  be exported when something was deleted.

	* Modify remove to allow -T to specify the
	  type (deb,dsc,udeb) to delete from.
